  securityModalText: `Your privacy and the security of patient information are the highest priorities. To ensure that data remains confidential:<br><br>
- <strong>Data Encryption:</strong> All data processed by the system is secured using industry-standard encryption methods. Transcripts and notes are linked exclusively to your encrypted personal API key and the device used for access, ensuring that only you have access to the generated content.<br><br>
- <strong>Automatic Deletion:</strong> Once a transcript or note is generated and displayed on your screen, it is automatically and irreversibly deleted from the servers within 2 minutes.<br><br>
- <strong>Unauthorized Access Protection:</strong> Even if unauthorized access to your API key were to occur, the data remains encrypted and secured by device-specific markers, rendering the information inaccessible.<br><br>
- <strong>GDPR-Compliant Hosting:</strong> All backend processes run on dedicated Microsoft Azure servers located within the EU, fully compliant with GDPR regulations.<br><br>
Rest assured, stringent security measures ensure that all patient-related data remains safe, confidential, and entirely under your control.`,
  aboutModalHeading: "About This Project",
  aboutModalText: `This website was created to provide healthcare professionals and other users with direct access to high-quality speech-to-text transcription and clinical note generation—without unnecessary costs or intermediaries.<br><br>
By using your own OpenAI API key, you connect directly to the source of the technology. This means you only pay the actual usage cost set by OpenAI, without markups or subscription fees.<br><br>
Many existing providers offer similar services but charge significantly more—often 8 to 10 times the real cost of the underlying technology. This platform offers the same functionality at a fraction of the price.<br><br>
<strong>Key points:</strong><br>
• No subscription, no account required.<br>
• You only pay OpenAI directly for what you use.<br>
• The website itself is completely free.<br><br>
To keep it that way, users are required to accept ads. Ad revenue helps cover hosting and operational costs so the service can remain accessible and free for everyone.`,
  guideModalHeading: "How to Set Up Your OpenAI API for Whisper Clinical Transcription",
  guideModalText: `To use this webapp, you must first create an OpenAI API profile, generate an API key, and fund your OpenAI wallet. Your API key is then copied and pasted into the provided API key field. Once you press Enter, the webapp saves the API key temporarily for your session—this key links you to the OpenAI servers so that speech-to-text transcription and note generation can work. Please note, you are charged immediately per task performed. For more info on cost, please review the "Cost" section on the front page.
<br><br>
<strong>1. Create Your OpenAI API Profile</strong><br>
To begin, you need to create a profile on the OpenAI API platform. This profile serves as your account for managing API keys and billing. To get started, visit the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" style="color:blue;">OpenAI API Signup</a> page. Follow the instructions to sign up by providing your email address, setting a password, and verifying your account. Once registered, you'll have access to your dashboard.
<br><br>
<strong>2. Generate an API Key</strong><br>
After creating your profile, generate an API key by navigating to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" style="color:blue;">API key management</a> page. Click the button to create a new API key. Important: You will only see your API key once. Copy it immediately and store it securely (e.g., in a text file) for future use. If you lose the key or suspect it has been compromised, delete it from your account and create a new one.
<br><br>
<strong>3. Fund Your OpenAI Wallet</strong><br>
For the webapp to function, your OpenAI wallet must have sufficient funds. Visit the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview" style="color:blue;">Billing & Payment</a> page to add funds. You can transfer any amount at any time. As long as funds are available, you'll be able to use the site—each task is charged immediately.
<br><br>
<strong>Session Security Reminder</strong><br>
When you log in by entering your API key, it is stored only temporarily in your browser session. This means if you exit the website, close your browser, or turn off your computer, the API key will not be saved. You will need to re-enter your API key the next time you use the webapp, ensuring your key remains secure.`,

<div>
  <h1>Cost Information</h1>
  <h2>Speech-to-Text Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $0.006 per minute. <em>Example:</em> A 15-minute consultation will cost 15 × $0.006 = <strong>$0.09</strong> per consultation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Note Generation Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Token-Based Pricing:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Input (transcription + prompt):</strong> $10 per 1,000,000 tokens (i.e. $0.00001 per token).</li>
      <li><strong>Output (generated note):</strong> $30 per 1,000,000 tokens (i.e. $0.00003 per token).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Example Consultation Calculation (Note Generation Only)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Input Calculation:</strong>
      <p>Assume the consultation transcription is about <strong>700 words</strong> and you add a <strong>30-word prompt</strong>.<br>
      Total words = 700 + 30 = <strong>730 words</strong>.<br>
      Estimated tokens = 730 × 0.75 ≈ <strong>547.5 tokens</strong>.<br>
      Input cost = 547.5 tokens × $0.00001 ≈ <strong>$0.0055</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Output Calculation:</strong>
      <p>Assume the generated note is around <strong>250 words</strong>.<br>
      Estimated tokens = 250 × 0.75 ≈ <strong>187.5 tokens</strong>.<br>
      Output cost = 187.5 tokens × $0.00003 ≈ <strong>$0.0056</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Total Note Generation Cost:</strong>
      <p>Combined cost ≈ $0.0055 + $0.0056 = <strong>$0.0111</strong> per consultation.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Approximate Combined Cost Per Consultation</h2>
  <p>(for a 15-minute consultation/recording, using both functions)</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speech-to-Text:</strong> <strong>$0.09</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Note Generation:</strong> <strong>$0.0111</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Total:</strong> Approximately <strong>$0.101</strong> per consultation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Monthly Cost Estimates</h2>
  <p>Assuming you conduct 20 consultations per day, 4 days per week, over 4 weeks per month (20 × 4 × 4 = <strong>320 consultations</strong> per month):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Using Only Speech-to-Text</strong> (with note generation via your own ChatGPT account, which is essentially free):<br>
      Monthly cost = 320 × $0.09 = <strong>$28.80</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Using Both Speech-to-Text and Note Generation:</strong><br>
      Monthly cost = 320 × $0.101 ≈ <strong>$32.32</strong>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Alternative Note Generation Option</h2>
  <p>If you already have an OpenAI account, you can use note generation via ChatGPT on your own profile—which is essentially free. In that case, you only incur the speech-to-text cost when using this webapp.</p>
  <h2>Usage Flexibility</h2>
  <p>Unlike providers that require a monthly subscription, you only pay per usage. If you take a day off, go on vacation, or have a period of no activity, your costs will be zero. Even if you use the service every day for all your patient consultations, the per-use cost remains significantly lower compared to other providers.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Direct Connection Advantage</h2>
  <p>Our webapp connects you directly with the OpenAI API—no intermediary, no extra fees. This direct link means you only pay for the actual AI processing cost, making our service one of the most affordable speech-to-text and note generation solutions available today.</p>
